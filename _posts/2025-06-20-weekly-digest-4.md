#### Comprehensive AI Integration Changed My Work Content and Habits
When using Cursor, the main feeling was that of pair programming - AI and I were doing the same thing, with me supervising the AI writing code.

But using Claude Code feels completely different - it's a pattern where I assign tasks to Claude Code, then go do other things, and then test, evaluate and modify the results after task completion. Overall, it's a higher degree of automation.

I think there are two important points here:
- The agent needs to be powerful enough - Claude currently feels like the most intelligent one.
- This involves changing the coding approach, transitioning from "writing code" ability to "system design", "prompt engineering" and "code review" abilities.

The second point can only be developed through more comprehensive use of the best AI.
