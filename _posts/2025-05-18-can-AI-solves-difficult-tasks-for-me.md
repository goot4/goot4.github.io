As AI get better and better in a astonishing speed, More and more people have started using AI, and AI is used in all kinds of fields and solving all kinds problems. Obviously, AI is good at some problems, but it sucks at some others. So my question is: Can AI solves difficult tasks for me?

## What tasks is difficult?

In my opinion, difficult things means something that you do not experience about, so you can not construct a clear recognition model about it in you mind. As a result, you can not harness this "difficult thing" to do what you want.

Here, I want to clearly  define the difference between experience and knowledge for the context. I suggest that, knowledge is general where as experience is personal. You can get knowledge about things from external resources but it may not suit your cases or you do not know how to apply it to your cases. **With trials, observations and reflections**, you can turn the knowledge into your unique experience.

Obviously, it is easy to get knowledge but hart to get experience. Because it takes your time and effort, and still, you may just be disappointed about the kind of "experience" you get at the end.

## So, is AI suit for difficult tasks?

I came to this question after I read this [blog post](https://seangoedecke.com/why-cant-ais-have-new-ideas/).  In this article, the author give two answer why AI can not have new idea:
1. AI can not do experiments to validate its idea, so the idea can not be developed to be useful.
2. AI may can actually have new idea, it is just that the development of AI is not good enough yet, it is a matter of time.

In my question, I focus on difficult tasks for individuals, which means it is harder for AI to do experiments for your unique cases.

AI might give some good advice based on the context that you provided, but you are the person to execute it and evaluate the result. If you do not do it yourself, you never know whether or not you should take the AI's advice.

So from this perspective, you can not make AI do difficult tasks for you because you do not know what should be done exactly and you can not evaluate the outcome. Instead, I suggest to use AI to gain the experience faster. With experience, difficult things become easy piece of cake, then you can delegate it to AI professionally.
## What to do?

Every thing about AI is changing rapidly, so should be our recognition for AI. it is likely that AI can overcome the disadvantage at execution and evaluation in the near future, so it can just do difficult things.

But for now, I think experience can be really precious as long as AI can not easily provide it for us. So I will go to get more experience.

What's your bet?
