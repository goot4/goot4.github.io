## What is this weekly digest about?

It is a new routine I plan to update weekly to write about what I have read and reflected for the last week. I will only write my own thought which is inspired from the articles.

### Why this routine?

I read a lot, and I always get inspiration from what I read. I want to share these inspirations. But it can be heavy work if I write an individual post for each of them. So, I choose to write them in an easier way, with some thinking, but not too extensive. I think readers can always get more from the original articles. What I provide is my way of thinking about the topic.

Let's start the fun.
## In a era of 0 common sense

Materials: https://ignatiusdhleechinese.substack.com/p/f20

First, what is common sense: it is knowledge that is supposed to be known by everyone in a society.

Common sense is going to be less common among people, and more likely to be wrong. There are two reasons:
1. People have more and more choices , which means less common experience. Without common experience, there can be no common sense.
2. World is changing rapidly, so the common sense gets outdated faster and faster.

### What to do?

Less common sense is just a reality, there is no good or bad about it.

People do not need common sense that much comparing to the past.

We can still get common sense. But it is more because we want it and put effort on getting it, not imposed by any external forces. The common sense can be built by sharing or doing things together.

In a word, Common sense is what makes sense for me, otherwise it is just no sense. And I think the Law should work the same way.

## When reading becomes the bottleneck ...

I have read a lot so far. As I get better at reading, I always want to read more and faster. But the problem is I read slowly because I like to pause and think a lot when I read something. I should say this is not always a good thing because some things that I read may be in bad quality or be irrelevant to me.

So I started to try listening to the materials using a text-to-speech software. The point is to get through them quickly and without that much of thinking. In this way, I can cover more materials with less effort. I am going to try this with less serious materials first and see how well it goes. The good result I expect would be that I can spend more thinking power for the things I want to focus on while establishing a pipeline for new ideas to get in and out of my mind efficiently on a daily basis.
