# Drink or Drink NOT

I used to drink some wine every week. But I will drink less now. 

The reason is that I have came across some articles about healthy lifestyle last month. And I start to appreciate a healthy and regular lifestyle. 

Lifestyle is like habits, you do it everyday without giving a thought about it. Imaging this, when you get up in the morning, you do not need to think about what to do, you just go to brush you teeth. And when you do it, you can just focus on it (or other things like listening to a broadcast). When it's done, you forget it and start to do the next thing. For me, the main advantage of lifestyle is that it saves my mental energy. 

Lifestyle is pretty strong. So I want my lifestyle to be as healthy as possible. Now, which lifestyle is healthy?

I am at start point and there is a lot details that I need time to figure out. For example, should I do meditation? Should I take a cold shower? Should I eat twice a day (no breakfast)? I do not think one way can always be healthy for everyone, so I need trying a lot to find what I like the most.

The things I am trying now:
- Regular meal time (8:00, 12:00, 18:40), no snacks.
- Regular sleep time (0:30 - 7:30)

# BTW, About AI

I will NOT use AI when I write my post, and it is really hard especially I write in English.

My main purpose of writing blog is about training my skill of thinking and expressing, in a concise and clear way. And I don't believe there is any shortcut when it comes to training. The harder you try, the more you get improved.

So, no more AI for my blog.
