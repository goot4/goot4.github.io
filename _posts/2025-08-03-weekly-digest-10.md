## AI
### News
New models:
- GLM-4.5 & GLM-4.5-Air

This months, many Chinese company open sourced their models, I started a new habit to give every one of them a try when they come out.
### Models
#### [Can small AI models think as well as large ones?](https://seangoedecke.com/cognitive-core/)
Pro:
- “cognitive core” is effective on training.
- Large models encoding more facts about the world than small ones, which maybe unnecessary and inefficient.

Con:
- reasoning ability might require a lot of background knowledge.
- reasoning ability requires many parameters.
- larger models will always be smarter.
