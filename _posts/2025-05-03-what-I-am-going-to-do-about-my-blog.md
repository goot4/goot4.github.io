# What's Next?

I am going to post more often, and I will write in English.

About a year ago, when I started my blog, I saw it as a way to build connections with people in the tech industry and showcase my abilities. I wrote about technical topics in Chinese. As a year has passed, I've reached a more stable state in both my life and career. Seeking connections and self-presentation are no longer my prioritized goals.

This year, I've developed a strong habit of reading extensively in English. It was overwhelming and awkward at first, but I've learned how to read and think in English. This is a precious skill for me. I've finally reached a stage where I can express my thoughts in English, and I'm happy to take on this challenge. Through this practice, I believe I can read more efficiently, think more quickly, and express myself more clearly.

I will continue to share what I've learned, not just about technology, but also about life and other topics that interest me. I won't just provide information for readers' convenience, but I'll also share my reasoning process.

# About Planning

Simple take: No more useless plans and schedules - I'm building habits.

Plans are what you feel forced to do, while habits are what you want to do.

I want to practice my English skills, so I'm going to build a habit of posting regularly.

I won't set concrete goals for the next 3 to 5 years about what level I want to reach or how many posts I want to write. I'll simply post when I want to and enjoy the process.

BTW, this post is revised by AI and I am really impressed how good it can be about grammar and native expression. It keeps my message and shows it in a better format. I am happy with this result, because format does not matter, only thinking do.
