I read a very interesting [article](Jevons Paradox: A personal perspective) this week, it mainly discussed why increased productivity can lead to more work. and I'd like to share some thinking about it.

## What is this article about?
I should proclaim that this is not a AI-summarizing-article-like paragraph. I am going to list some interesting points in the article, and I restate them in my own words so I can remember them better:
- The time saved by increased productivity becomes time reinvested, often with compound interest.
- Metrics of progress have continuously abstracted, and possibility of individuals become infinite. 
- Measuring what matters is more important than doing things.
- What matters: being you. Productivity is no longer the scarce resource. You are the one decide what is worth doing.

## My prediction
I agree with most arguments in this article. I make my prediction on the future based on it and my personal assumptions.
Here are my *assumptions*: 
1. Human's desire will never get fulfilled, but **good** society and civilization can help people constraint their desires, which leads to true happiness -- inner peace.
2. **Every** Human are going to have a better future.

So, in short term, people will keep on increasing productivity but still do the same things, which leads to intensified competitions. But in long terms, people can do whatever they want with more choice and less limitations, and they can just do it for the sake of it.

I'd suggest picking a hobby. So, when robot takes away your job, you can still find something to do.
