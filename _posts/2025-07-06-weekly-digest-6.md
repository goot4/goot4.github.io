## Future Topic Direction
I will not focus on the technical details (how to do things), but on a higher level -- what to do.

The reason why it's that information becomes irrelevant very fast. A "how to do things" article may become outdated in one week. On the other hand, a "what to do" article may matters in a longer period of time (One month I presume).

Another reason is that, with AI, people can easily figure out how to do things. So this kind of information become very cheap. But people now get confused about what to do more often.
## AI
### Continuous AI
Materials:
- [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai/)
- [Continuous AI in software engineering](https://seangoedecke.com/continuous-ai/)
- [Continuous AI in Simon Willison's Weblog](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/27/continuous-ai/#atom-everything)

Github define *Continuous AI* as **all uses of automated AI to support software collaboration on any platform**. Key points here is *automated* and *collaboration*.

In Sean Goedecke's Blog, Continuous AI means repetitive workflows, it is the *ambient intelligence* in the software development lifecycle. And he lists some examples:
- Automated AI driven PR
- AI driven issues
- Daily or weekly summary rollups
- code autocomplete

This does not mean delegate the work to AI completely, but add a layer of check.
