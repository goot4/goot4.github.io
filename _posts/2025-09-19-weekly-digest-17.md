## Content Plan Updated
This weekly digest has now reached its 17th edition, which means 4 months of reading. I think it is really a lot, and a lot about AI. I have learned tons of ideas from various materials. And reading blogs has become my new hobby.

As I keep practicing my reading skill, I find I can filter irrelevant materials more rapidly, so I can read more and get what matters to me. And I will keep reading and sharing in the weekly digest as usual.

On the other hand, I find that I have read too much but do too little. Reading takes up a large amount of time in my life. So I decided to read less, but do more practice to get real experience on things. Then I will try to share this experience on this weekly digest as well. By the way, I think this can also train my writing skill, which is really the next bottleneck to overcome.

#### models need tokens to think
Basically, each token represents a fixed, finite amount of computation in the process of inference. So to get better answers, one way is to distribute computation to more tokens, which means thinking.

Note: ChatGPT web app can use code (Python) to do some calculations.
