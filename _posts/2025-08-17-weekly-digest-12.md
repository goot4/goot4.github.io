## AI

### AI and Humanity
#### [1910: The Year the Modern World Lost Its Mind](https://www.derekthompson.org/p/1910-the-year-the-modern-world-lost)
Fast pacing of technology developments gave people anxiety and new perspective about society in 1910.

I want to make two predictions about future:
- Children will need more time to learn before they can do something that create value, or not at all.
- It is hard for older people to adapt AI because they can not let go their old experiences, can not start as a beginner.
