## Repo Notes

- The upstream starter remote is already configured as `chirpy`.
- Main config is in `_config.yml`.
- Posts live in `_posts/`.
- Tabs live in `_tabs/`.
- Generated output is `_site/`; do not edit it manually.
- `assets/lib` is a git submodule; avoid changing it unless the task is explicitly about static assets or upgrades.

## Common Commands

- `bundle install`: install Ruby gem dependencies for the site.
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`: start the local Jekyll development server.
- `bash tools/run.sh`: start the local server with the repo helper script and livereload.
- `bash tools/test.sh`: build the site in production mode and run `htmlproofer` checks.
- `bash tools/sync-posts.sh`: sync posts from `~/Documents/MyWorld/4-Archive/blog` into `_posts/` with `rsync --delete`.
